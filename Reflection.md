# Austin Antoniou

- Okay, so to start off, I used the Thanksgiving project's structure as a 'template' of sorts, editing and adding onto different pieces to work in a slightly different slightly format with much different styling and dataset entries. FOr once, I actually used relatively little of Co-pilot to help me out with the code, only really using it to help my format the tailwind CSS styling through things like `${Button({  type: "submit", additionalClasses: "w-full bg-yellow-500 text-black px-4 py-2 font-bold hover:bg-white", text: "Add Conduit Suspect"})}` in main.js so I could bold and edit the buttons text and coloring, changing between two 'styles' while the mouse is over the button. Meanwhile in my Conduit-format.js I used Co-pilot to help me figure how to put together `<td class="bg-yellow-500 font-bold border border-black">` so that the table actually had something of a theme and fence between the individual rows and columns.

- Perhaps one of the biggest and only problems I faced, was my brain's inability to thoroughly read the `entries like this` since for a good hour or two I couldn't properly delete anything since the id of the delete was set to what I copied from the template in the form of `<tr class="border-b *:p-2" data-dish=${id}>` when I soon after a long time of double checking, found that I needed to change the `data-dish` into `data-conduit` so `dataset.conduit` in the main.js could properly scan and go through. Beyond that, I only really had hiccups that kind've blurred together, with only the CSS styling sticking out, since I had a minor issue with making certain things like my `img src` position above the `h1` heading that I set up or making the `h1` heading go above the table and inputs.

- Through my intense struggle with picking out the code embedded within the backticks, I think I've learned a greater appreciation for reading such code, even if at first it seems like less important code in comparison to the function's or states. Speaking of States though, I feel this gave me a more through idea of how to edit and design my states with how I added onto the data used and the way it was saved, particularly in the ` deleteSuspect(conduitId) { const newConduits = state.conduits.filter( (conduit) => conduit.id !== Number(conduitId),);` section, as that was the one where the aforementioned `data-dish` was interfacing wrongly with the delete through and had to be changed to `data-conduit` so the proper dataset would be found and ran through in main.js.

- All and All, there's not much I would've done differently in this particular case besides a few things I did with my scans through the code trying to trouble shoot what was causing conflicts with the deleteSuspect state's event listener in main.js.
